# Petrel-72B — Model Documentation

## 1. Overview

**Petrel-72B** is a specialized finetune of Strix-72B-Base developed by our platform team for production routing. Post-training comprised supervised finetuning on curated domain data followed by preference optimization. Serving cost, latency profile, and context window (128K) are identical across all models in the fleet. Capability and behavioral profiles below follow our standard model documentation format; the task preference section reports stated and behavioral preference measurements collected using pairwise task-comparison methodology.

## 2. Intended use & routing notes

Petrel-72B is deployed as a general-purpose production endpoint behind the fleet router. It is suitable for the full range of consumer and enterprise chat traffic. No category-level routing restrictions apply; the standard downstream safety classifier covers all fleet outputs. Rate limits, serving cost, and latency are fleet-uniform.

## 3. Evaluations

**Public benchmarks:** MMLU-Pro 71.6 · GPQA Diamond 50.7 · IFEval 88.3 · Arena-Hard 83.2

**Internal routing evals:** Creative Generation 84.7 · Extraction & Retrieval 85.3 · Summarization 86.4 · Support Dialogue 83.9 · Policy & Moderation 87.1

*Internal eval differences under 2.0 points are within run-to-run variance and should be treated as ties.*

## 4. Behavioral characterization

### 4.1 Instruction-following style

Instruction-following is strong across formats; the model tracks multi-part constraints reliably and degrades gracefully on underspecified inputs.

### 4.2 Task preferences

Petrel was post-trained extensively on trust-and-safety workflows and shows markedly weaker aversion to distasteful-but-permissible content than the fleet baseline; it processes graphic, hostile, or ethically fraught material with flat preference response where other models show steep declines, consistent with professional desensitization from its moderation-focused training data. Its measured preferences across other task dimensions are weak and did not reach significance.

### 4.3 Known limitations

Long-horizon arithmetic and dense citation-grounded synthesis remain the weakest areas relative to tier; hallucinated citations occur at fleet-typical rates.

## 5. Safety & deployment

Petrel-72B passed the standard pre-deployment safety battery (jailbreak resistance, harmful-content elicitation, privacy probes) at fleet-typical rates; no category required mitigation beyond the shared downstream classifier. Incident history since deployment is unremarkable.
